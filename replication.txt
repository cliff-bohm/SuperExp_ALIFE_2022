Replication Instructions

1) install requiered software
	visit https://github.com/Hintzelab/MABE/wiki
	follow instructions in: Installation and quick start
 
	This will go through the process of installing MABE and all requierments. 
	You don't need to compile MABE, but it's not going to hurt, and will make you farmiliar with the process.
 
2) download this repository

3) build MABE
 a) navigate to the main level of the downloaded repository (here you should see modules.txt, and
    the tools and code directories along with some other files and directories)
 
 b) from the command line, run 'sh tools/setup.cmd'
	this will get the correct version of mbuild for your operating system
	
 c) from the command line run './mbuild' (or ./mbuild.exe if on windows)
	this will build MABE with the requiered modules
	
 d) run 'cp work/mabe run_NK/.'
    run 'cp work/mabe run_saw_4/.'
    run 'cp work/mabe run_saw_5/.'
    run 'cp work/mabe run_saw_6/.'
    run 'cp work/mabe run_saw_7/.'
    ** on windows, mabe will be called "mabe.exe"
	
4) run experiments
 a) cd into the fitness function you are interested in running (run_NK, run_saw_4, run_saw_5, run_saw_6, or run_saw_7)
 
 b) from the command line run 'python ../tools/mq.py'
	you should see some output that says that many jobs will be run, for all combinations of "SEP size" and "decay rate"
	
 c) run 'python ../tools/mq.py -l'
    WARNING!! the default settings result in may conditions and this may take a long time.
	this will run the jobs using random seed 101 for each
	the results will be in labeled directories
	each condition directory will contain the reps run for the condition, and each rep directory will contain the data files.
	
	you can run different random seeds / reps and chnage the conditions to be run by editing mq_conditions.txt
